# AI Exposure Explorer

The **AI Exposure Explorer** is a beta web application designed to help users explore the potential impact of AI on various occupations and college majors. Using mock data, this tool visualizes two key dimensions of AI impact:

- **Replacement Risk:** The percentage of tasks in a career that could potentially be automated by AI.
- **Complementary AI:** The degree to which AI might enhance human capabilities within the field.

> **Note:** This is a beta version that uses simulated data. Future versions will incorporate real-world datasets.
